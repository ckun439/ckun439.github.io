                        I graduated from the University of Auckland with a double major in Information management and technology and psychology back in 2021. Over 2022 I have been working towards a diploma in Web and UX design at Yoobee Creative Technologies.

                            Our task was to create a web application for a niche market that allowed users to input information of their selling items and list on the listing web page to sell products. This solution required the following resources - Build Database from Mongo DB, Build CRUD API using node.js – express, HTML and CSS coding to build the web pages, using Vue to retrieve input info, javascript for the popup windows and creating a brand from scratch (Logo, colour etc). Note: must run backend (port 5000 // npm run dev) for full experience.
